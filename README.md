# NFT Collection dApp

## Description

In this project I was able to create a NFT Collection dApp. In this project the recommendations were as follows:

- There should only exist 20 Crypto Dev NFT's and each one of them should be unique.

- User's should be able to mint only 1 NFT with one transaction.
Whitelisted users, should have a 5 min presale period before the actual sale where they are guaranteed 1 NFT per transaction.

- There should be a website for your NFT Collection.


The dapp was created using Nextjs, Alchemy API and hardhat for contract deployement.
